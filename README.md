Statistics and Programming Assessment 4

This is a temporary storage space for my answer scripts to Assessment 4 of ENGG185 - Introduction to Statistics and Programming. It contains the source code to all answers, as such I have waited until the last hour to upload this to try and stop fellow students from finding this.

If this needs to be taken down, please do send me a message and I will make the repository private as soon as possible.

Please note: If you try to run this code you will get different values to my answers, simply due to the nature of generating random numbers.
This may have been a unintentional mistake, as the variable 'seed' was not used at all in the question code to generate numbers, thus not keeping the same numbers at each run of the code.
